Hello,
This is a quick introduction of the project I am about to make.
I am making a version of the Google Homepage using HTML and CSS to make it look (not function) like the actual Google Homepage.

<This is a comment after trying to make it happen>
   I actually found it quite challenging, not gonna lie. I am going to educate myself a little bit more before returning here and hopefully fixing my mistakes.
